    <h1>YouTube Analytics</h1>
    <h2 class="chart1title">Goal:</h2>
    <div class="chart1">
        <div>
            <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>The first thing I wanted to find out is why I watch YouTube. <br>
            It turns out that I mostly watch YouTube to relax, <br>
            closely followed by wanting to inform myself. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chart2">
        <h2>Total time watched:</h2>
        <div>
            <div id="totalTime">
            </div>
            <p>I also wanted to find out what my <br> 
                total amount of time was spent on YouTube. <br>
                I'm kind of surprised it's this low, but that might be <br> 
                because I've been working on school projects.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart3">
        <h2>Amount of rabbitholes:</h2>
        <p>I tend to go down rabbitholes whilst watching YouTube, <br> 
            which is when I watch more than one video on one subject after one another. <br>
            I went down
        </p>
        <div id="rabbitholes">
        </div>
        <p>rabbitholes since the end of November. Which makes sense <br> 
            since I did personal research on multiple subjects, like nuclear weapons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chart4">
        <h2>Topic VS anxiety:</h2>
        <canvas id="myChart2"></canvas><br>
        <p>I also gathered data to explore the relationship between my top five video topics and whether they caused me anxiety.<br>
            This makes sense, since I watch videos in the gaming and art category to relax, and whilst I like learning about <br>
            history, science, and scams, they do cause some anxiety when it's about serious subjects.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chart5">
        <h2>Top YouTubers:</h2>
        <div id="topYouTubers">
        </div><br>
        <p>Last, I wanted to know who my top five YouTubers are. <br>
            These are the YouTubers I watch every upload of as soon as they come out, so this was expected.</p>
